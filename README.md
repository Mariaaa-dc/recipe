# My Favorite Banana Bread Recipe

### How to Mash Bananas
1. ***Break or slice the spotty bananas into large pieces*** and place in the bowl of your stand mixer—or use a regular mixing bowl and your hand mixer.
2. Begin beating on low, then gradually increase to medium-high speed as the bananas break down into mashed banana.
3. ***Transfer the bananas to another bowl*** and use the mixing bowl for the butter and sugar. (No need to clean it—some mashed banana remnants is fine.)
